Selected Functional Requirement:

"As a user I want to browse meals to see what I can order/make."

Selected Nonfunctional Requirement:

"As a user I want the platform to be easy and intuitive to use so that I don't need a lot of time to understand how to use it."

Reasoning:
I selected the functionality of browsing meals because it represents the core of the platform. 
Browsing meals is the first step a user needs to take in order to see what can be ordered, which ingredients are required, and which meal categories are available. 
All other functionalities are derived from this core feature; therefore, it should be the main focus of the application at the beginning.

I chose the non-functional requirement of the platform being easy and intuitive to use because usability is one of the most important aspects of any system designed for external users.
If browsing meals is not easy to understand or use, users are likely to switch to another platform, as the goal is to support meal planning rather than require users to first learn how to use the system.

The browsing experience should encourage users to explore different meals, compare options, and discover new ideas. 
To motivate users to interact with the platform in this way, the interface must feel intuitive and natural. These two requirements are the user’s first impression of the platform and therefore 
need to be implemented correctly so that the remaining functionality can be effectively used.
